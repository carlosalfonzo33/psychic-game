# psychic-game


A basic game built using Javascript, HTML5, and CSS3. The app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. "Guess what letter I'm thinking of"


1. Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
2. Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
3. Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
4. Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed are displayed until the user either wins or loses.)
5. When the player wins, the Wins counter increased and the game  starts over again (without refreshing the page).
6. When the player loses, the Losses counter increases and restarts the game without a page refresh.
